# Twitter sentiment analysis using data from Twitter API
It is no longer difficult to understand what people think about a topic by analysing the tweets shared by people. Sentiment analysis is one of the most popular use cases for NLP (Natural Language Processing).
I am going to use “Tweepy,” which is an easy-to-use Python library for accessing the Twitter API. 

Through this project we can be analyse what people think about a particular topic. I have used the example of the FIFA worldcup as it was one of the trending topics of the day.

I have also cleaned the data to obtain a more accurate dataset for sentiment analysis using NLP.
I can use cleaned text to calculate polarity, subjectivity, sentiment, negative, positive, neutral and compound parameters.

I also built n gram models to help predict the word most probably that might follow a particular sequence.
